## Chapter 1 day 1

111 Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.

Blockchain is a given open (together with it everyone is able to interact), dispersed (in the absence of a common owner) public basis of information


111 Explain what a Smart Contract is. 

smart contract is a given project that includes a set of functions and information located according to a specific blockchain address.


111 Explain the difference between a script and a transaction

transaction ----- this category of sequential actions together with the basis of information, which is considered a natural thing, activity together with information. The transaction is capable of either ending and also ending safely, together with the observance of the unity of information and also regardless of other synchronous transactions, or in general, it does not end at all, and also in this case it is not obliged to have practically any result.
script ----- reads data from the blockchain, absolutely does not require anything, and absolutely nothing is needed

222 What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

Clarity
Safety and Security
Developer Experience
Resource Oriented Programming
Approachability  

222 In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

1. Decentralization
The blockchain does not in any way contain a common middle of control or a zone of conservation, and all members of the bond, without exception, the sections of which are located according to the whole society, receive direct assistance in maintaining functionality. In accordance with this, the decrees according to the work of this kind of bonds are taken with the utmost simplicity, and the line itself is very stable. Blockchain is very difficult to break, someone is not subject to censorship in any way, and the leadership of one company or country is impossible.
2. Data security
The repeated repetition of information from among its accomplices ensures the security and permanence of the data embedded in the blockchain. Most of this, in the power of the features of blockchain devices, this data cannot be changed, edited or removed. And the use of consensus algorithms indicates, regarding this, that all transactions entered into the blockchain, without exception, are proven.
3. Transparency of transactions
Any partner in the bond has access to the entire transaction chronicle, right up to the most 1 transaction. For this reason, in order to control whether this or another transaction has passed among 2 addresses, it is enough to resort to their event stored in the blockchain.
4. High transaction speed
Since blockchain bonds are considered peer-to-peer, transactions are made directly among users, beyond the connection with their location and also in the absence of the role of arbitrators. The presence of this line is constantly available for the purpose of users, does not contain a narrow period of activity in any way, and also does not turn off in any way during solemn times.
5. Reduce transaction costs
Because of this, while blockchain networks are considered peer-to-peer, there is no need to refer to arbiter proposals in order to complete a transaction. In a similar way, due to the blockchain, users have every chance to facilitate transaction control, reduce the period of transaction control, increase high liquidity, and also reduce the dangers of fraud. Most of this, users of the blockchain bonds pay a commission due to the proof of transactions, which, according to comparison with classical economic institutions like banks, is much lower.
